# Assignment_2
this is the group of 3 computer science student who contributed on the development
of codes for this assignment.
Those are:                                    
    1.Ndiramiye Ninshuti Poli --------------------- with reg no    :222002045                                                                                   
    2.Nsanzimana Prince Kelvin -------------------- with reg no    :222015797                                                                
    3.Muneza Joseph ------------------------------- with reg no    :222006232

And in addition we can also describe our codes as follow

    1.the one called magic.cpp
    
This C++ code takes user input for the dimension and elements of a square matrix. It checks whether the matrix is a magic square (a square matrix with equal sums of rows, columns, and main diagonals) by calculating the sums of rows, columns, and diagonals and comparing them. If the sums match, it returns true (indicating it's a magic square), otherwise false (not a magic square).

    2.the one called power4
    
This C++ program is a two-player Power4 (connect-four) game. It uses a 2D array to represent the game board, and players take turns to drop their pieces         ('X' or 'O'). The program checks for wins in rows, columns, and diagonals and declares the winner when a player connects four pieces.
